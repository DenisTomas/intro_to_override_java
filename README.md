# Geometric Figures Area Calculation

This TypeScript project calculates the area of geometric figures, specifically rectangles and right-angled triangles. It utilizes the principles of inheritance and method overriding in object-oriented programming.

## Features

- **Rectangle Area Calculation:** The `Rectangle` class inherits from the abstract class `GeometricFigure` and overrides the `calculateArea()` method to calculate the area of a rectangle.

- **Right-Angled Triangle Area Calculation:** The `RightAngledTriangle` class also inherits from the `GeometricFigure` class and overrides the `calculateArea()` method to calculate the area of a right-angled triangle.

- **Application Execution:** The `Application` class is responsible for executing the application. It creates instances of `Rectangle` and `RightAngledTriangle` and calls the `calculateArea()` method for each instance.

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Application class.

##Example Output:

Rectangle area: 50.0
Right-angled triangle area: 25.0
